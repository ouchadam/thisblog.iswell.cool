Bought from [Massdrop](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/sentraq-60-diy-keyboard-kit), the Sentraq S60-X is like the name hints, a 60% DIY mechanical keyboard.

Here's the finished result -

set up: Make sure you have everything you need, soldering iron, solder, sponge etc

<br>

Stabilizers stabilizers stabilizers!!! You might be tempted to start inserting switches straight into the plate <i>(I was, did and ended up having to undo all of them)</i> but hold off, it will make the build 10x harder, if not impossible to line up the plate to the board.

The stabilizers themselves are a little fiddly to put together, but simple enough once you've done one. When mounting the stabilizers be careful to align them correctly to your layout (I went with ansi).

[Jack Humbert](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUodUNwfU_X_W_8nkUNQDkg) provides a fantastic [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2FApwzVxAQ) on how to assemble and mount the stabilizers, it's for a different DIY board but it's still relevant.

Next up is mounting the plate. Part of the reason for inserting the stabilizers first is because the plate goes on top! <i>(dur)</i>. When resting on just the stabilizers the plate is a bit wobbly, this goes away as more switches are soldered to the board but it does make the first few a bit tricky.

Soldering the switches around the corner positions tighted the plate up to the board and meant the remaining switches needed less pressure to keep the pins fully penetrated.

solder the rest of the switches, E Z.


Until you encounter a problem... the diode on D60 , solder the path directly.
