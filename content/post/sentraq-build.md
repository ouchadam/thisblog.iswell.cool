Bought from [Massdrop](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/sentraq-60-diy-keyboard-kit), the Sentraq S60-X is like the name hints, a 60% DIY mechanical keyboard.

set up: Make sure you have everything you need, soldering iron, solder, sponge etc


1. Stabilizers stabilizers stabilizers!!! You might be tempted to start inserting switches straight into the plate <i>(I was, did and ended up having to undo all of them)</i> but hold off, it will make the build 10x harder, if not impossible to line up the plate to the board. Mount the stabilizers first and be careful to align them correctly to your layout (I went with ansi).

2. place a few switches in the corners for structural integrity

3. solder the rest of the switches, E Z.


Until you encounter a problem... the diode on D60 , solder the path directly.
